# Mandelbrot Set and Julia Set Generator
This is a C# Winforms program created in Visual Studio 2022 which generates a Mandelbrot set. 
After clicking anywhere on the generated image, you can then generate the corresponding Julia set for those specific coordinates.

Credit goes to The Coding Train on Youtube for his videos on generating the Mandelbrot set and Julia set in p5.js, which was simple enough to translate into C# (and even Scratch! Here's the link to that version of the Mandelbrot Set: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/706767002/)
